=> What is a function?
    Function is a set of code which can be used repeatedly without re-writing.
    They help us to save time, minimize errors and save space in a script

=> How to create a function:
    function_name() {
      statement_1
      statement_2
    }

=> Calling a function:
    function_name

=> Example:

  display_message(){
    echo "Welcome to Shell Scripting."
  }

  display_message

=> Local variables are defined inside a function and can only be accessed within that function, while global variables are defined outside a function that can be accessed and modified by any part of the script.

=> It is generally a good practice to use local variables whenever possible and only use global variables when necessary.

=> Example:

    text="Welcome to Shell Scripting variables." // use of global variables. they are declared outside the functions.

    display_message(){
        local message="Welcome to Shell Scripting." // use of local variables
        echo "$message"
    }
